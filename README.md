# Exploratory Data Analysis of Anti-phishing Datasets

## Description
This repository contains notebooks for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on multimodal anti-phishing datasets. The datasets provided encompass various components such as URLs, HTML source code, screenshot images, and more. The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into phishing attempts and legitimate instances by exploring key statistics and visualizing important information.

## Key Feautres

- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Each dataset is explored in a separate notebook, allowing for in-depth analysis and comparison of phishing and legitimate samples.
- **Statistical Insights:** The notebooks provide insights into missing data, average text lengths, SSL distribution, website languages, and URL characteristics such as domains and Top-Level Domains (TLD).
- **Visualizations:** Visualizations including pie charts, plots, and graphs are utilized to effectively present the analysis results, aiding in understanding and interpretation.

## Data Files

Below are links to download Parquet files for five different datasets utilized in this project. Each dataset comprises two files: one for phishing and the other for legitimate instances.

Ensure to download the files and adjust the paths accordingly in the notebooks.
